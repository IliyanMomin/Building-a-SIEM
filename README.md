# Building-a-SIEM

## Objective

We will build a SIEM system using Elastic Security, focusing on real-time threat detection and malware analysis. This involves setting up the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and optional Logstash) and deploying Elastic Agents on endpoints to collect security logs. We will configure detection rules to identify malware and suspicious activity, using Kibana dashboards for monitoring and analysis. To ensure effectiveness, we will simulate attacks and refine detection rules for accuracy. The goal is to create a proactive security monitoring solution that enhances threat detection and response capabilities.
